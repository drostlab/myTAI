\title{Create Petal Plot for Gene Removal Analysis}
\usage{
petal_plot(sets, p = 0.5)
}
\arguments{
\item{sets}{List of gene sets from GATAI runs}

\item{p}{Consensus threshold (default: 0.5)}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 petal plot
}
\description{
Create a petal plot showing how many genes are removed per run
relative to the consensus set.
}
\details{
This function creates a petal plot visualization showing the relationship
between individual GATAI runs and the consensus gene set, highlighting
how many genes are unique to each run.
# Create petal plot
# petal <- petal_plot(gatai_runs, p = 0.5)
