\title{Calculate Gene Expression Angles}
\usage{
get_angles(e)
}
\arguments{
\item{e}{Matrix of expression values with genes as rows and stages as columns}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of angles representing each gene's expression pattern
}
\description{
Calculate developmental stage angles for genes based on their expression patterns.
}
\details{
This function uses PCA to project genes and ideal expression patterns into 2D space,
then calculates the angle of each gene relative to ideal patterns. The angles
represent the peak expression timing during development.
