\title{Plot Gene Space Using PCA}
\usage{
plot_gene_space(
  phyex_set,
  top_p = 0.2,
  genes = NULL,
  colour_by = c("stage", "strata")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{phyex_set}{A PhyloExpressionSet object}

\item{top_p}{Proportion of most dynamic genes to include when genes=NULL (default: 0.2)}

\item{genes}{Character vector of specific genes to plot. If NULL, uses top dynamic genes}

\item{colour_by}{Character string specifying coloring scheme:
"stage" (by peak expression stage) or "strata" (by phylostratum) (default: "stage")}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the gene space PCA plot
}
\description{
Create a PCA plot showing genes in expression space with ideal expression
patterns overlaid as reference points.
}
\details{
This function creates a PCA visualization of genes in expression space, with ideal
expression patterns (early, mid, late, reverse mid) overlaid as reference points.
The analysis uses log-transformed and standardized expression values. Genes are
colored either by their phylostratum or by their peak expression stage.
}
\examples{
# Plot gene space colored by stage
# p1 <- plot_gene_space(phyex_set, colour_by = "stage")

# Plot specific genes colored by strata
# p2 <- plot_gene_space(phyex_set, genes = c("gene1", "gene2"), colour_by = "strata")

}
